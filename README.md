# OpenGL-Window

This has been renamed GameLib2 and moved to -> https://github.com/imgelling/GameLib2

It is called GameLib2 because I wanted to re-write the original, https://github.com/imgelling/GameLib, 
and add more rendering apis.  Rewriting also allowed me to remove a bunch of external libraries and clean up
a lot of code.

I also wanted it to be a bit cleaner in the repository.
